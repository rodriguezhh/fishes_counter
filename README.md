# Fish Counter using Artificial Vision
This repository contains the design files for a fish counter using artificial vision. The files are divided into three folders:

Archivos SolidWorks: This folder contains the SolidWorks files for the fish counter.
2D Files: This folder contains the 2D drawings for the fish counter.
3D Printing Files: This folder contains the files for 3D printing the fish counter.
To get started, clone the repository and open the SolidWorks files in SolidWorks. You can then use the 2D drawings to create a bill of materials and order the parts. Once you have the parts, you can assemble the fish counter and start counting fish!
